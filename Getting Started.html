    <image-tag>Fig. 2.1 Three basic choices to start ANSYS</image-tag>
    
    <custom-style>ANSYS Workbench:</custom-style> This is a new GUI with an emphasis on CAD connectivity,
    ease of use, and easy management of assembly contact.<br>
    <custom-spacing><custom-style>ANSYS:</custom-style> This starts ANSYS in the traditional GUI. The program starts
    immediately using the settings last changed under the next item, ‘Configure
    ANSYS Products’.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-style>Configure ANSYS Products:</custom-style> This choice brings up the ANSYS Launcher.<br>
    <custom-spacing>ANSYS has many finite-element analysis capabilities, ranging from a
    simple, linear, static analysis to a complex, nonlinear, transient dynamic
    analysis.</custom-spacing>The process for a typical analysis involves three general tasks:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Building the model
        <li>Applying loads and obtaining the solution
        <li>Reviewing the results.
    </ul>
    <sub-heading>2.1.1 Building the Model</sub-heading><br>
    <custom-spacing>Building a finite element model requires more time than any other part
    of the analysis. First, specify a jobname and analysis title. Then, use the
    preprocessor to define the element type(s), element real constant(s), material
    properties and the model geometry.</custom-spacing>
    <sub-heading>2.1.1.1 Specifying a Jobname and Analysis Title</sub-heading>
    This task is not required for an analysis, but is recommended.
    <b>Defining the Jobname</b>
    The <custom-style>jobname </custom-style> a name that identifies an analysis job. When the
    analyst defines a jobname for an analysis, the jobname becomes the first part
    of the name of all files the program creates. The extension or suffix for these
    files&#39; names is a file identifier such as .DB. Using a jobname for each analysis,
    ensures that no files are overwritten.
    If a jobname is not specified, all files receive the name FILE or file,
    depending on the operating system. The default jobname can be changed
    using  <custom-process>Utility Menu&gt; File&gt; Change Jobname.</custom-process>
    <b>Defining an Analysis Title</b>
    <custom-process>Utility Menu&gt; File&gt;</custom-process> Change Title defines a title for the analysis. The
    program includes the title on all graphics displays and on the solution output.
    <b>Defining Units</b>
    The program does not assume a system of units for the analysis. Any
    system of units can be used so long as the same system is used for all the
    data entered.
    <sub-heading>2.1.1.2 Defining Element Types</sub-heading>
    The element library contains more than 150 different element types.
    Each element type has a unique number and a prefix that identifies the
    element category: PLANE182, SOLID185, BEAM188, ELBOW290, and so on.
    The element type determines, among other things:
    <ul>
        <li> degree-of-freedom set
        <li>Whether the element lies in 2-D or 3-D space.
    </ul>
    BEAM188, for example, has six structural degrees of freedom (UX, UY,
    UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ), is a line element, and can be modeled in 3-D
    space.  User must be in the general preprocessor to define element types.
    While defining the actual elements, point to the appropriate type reference
    number using the <custom-process>Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Modeling&gt; Create&gt;
    Elements&gt; Elem Attributes.</custom-process>
    <sub-heading>2.1.1.3 Defining Element Real Constants</sub-heading>
    Element real constants are properties that depend on the element
    type, such as the cross-sectional properties of a beam element. Not all
    element types require real constants, and different elements of the same type
    may have different real constant values.
    As with element types, each set of real constants has a reference
    number, and the table of reference number versus real constant set is called
    the real <custom-style>constant table.</custom-style> While defining the elements, point to the appropriate
    real constant reference number using <custom-process>Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt;
    Modeling&gt; Create&gt; Elements&gt; Elem Attributes.</custom-process>
    <sub-heading>2.1.1.4 Defining Material Properties</sub-heading>
    Most element types require material properties. Depending on the
    application, material properties can be linear or nonlinear. As with element
    types and real constants, each set of material properties has a material
    reference number. The table of material reference numbers versus material
    property sets is called the material table. Within one analysis, there may be
    multiple material property sets. The program identifies each set with a unique
    reference number.
    <b>Linear Material Properties</b>
    Linear material properties can be constant or temperature-dependent,
    and isotropic or orthotropic. Use <custom-style>Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt; Material
    Props&gt; Material Models</custom-style> to define constant  material properties.
    Also specify the appropriate property label; for example EX, EY, EZ for
    Young&#39;s modulus, KXX, KYY, KZZ for thermal conductivity, and so forth. For
    isotropic material it is necessary to define only the X-direction property; the
    other directions default to the X-direction value.
    Besides the defaults for Y- and Z-direction properties (which default to
    the X-direction properties), other material property defaults are built in to
    reduce the amount of input. For example, Poisson&#39;s ratio (NUXY) defaults to
    0.3 and shear modulus (GXY) defaults to EX/2(1+NUXY).
    The analyst can choose constant, isotropic, linear material properties
    from a material library available through the GUI. Young&#39;s modulus, density,
    coefficient of thermal expansion, Poisson&#39;s ratio, thermal conductivity and
    specific heat are available for 10 materials in four unit systems.
    <b>Material Model Interface</b>
    The program GUI includes an intuitive hierarchical tree structure
    interface for defining many material models. A logical top-down arrangement
    of material categories guides in defining the appropriate model for the
    analysis.
    <b>Accessing the Material Model Interface</b>
    Access the material model interface via <custom-process>Main Menu&gt; Preprocessor&gt;
    Material Props&gt; Material Models.</custom-process> The <b>Define Material Model
    Behavior</b> dialog box appears, which originally displays the top level of the
    tree structure, as shown in Fig. 2.2.
    <custom-spacing><div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="./II__Ansys_Operations/2.jpg" alt="image" width="400px"></span>
    </div></custom-spacing> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 2.2  Material Model Interface Initial Screen</image-tag>
    
    <b>Choosing Material Behavior</b><br>
    The <b>Material Models Available</b> window on the right displays a list of
    material categories. If a category is preceded by a folder icon, there are
    subcategories available under the main category. On double-clicking on the
    category, the subcategories appear indented, and below the category as
    shown in Fig. 2.3.
    <custom-spacing><div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="./II__Ansys_Operations/3.jpg" alt="image" width="400px"></span>
    </div></custom-spacing> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 2.3  Material Model Interface Tree Structure</image-tag>
    
    For example, under Structural are categories Linear, Nonlinear, and
    others. The models are further categorized so that the analyst will eventually
    see a vertical list of material property sets or material models that are
    included under that category. Once it is decided which material property set
    or model will be used, then choose it by double-clicking on the item. A dialog
    
    5
    
    box appears that prompts for the required input data for that  particular
    model or property set.
    <b>Entering Material Data</b>
    Included in a data input dialog box is a table whose rows and columns
    can be altered depending on the requirements of the specific material
    property or model chosen. A typical data input dialog box is shown in Fig. 2.4.
    <custom-spacing><div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="./II__Ansys_Operations/4.jpg" alt="image" width="400px"></span>
    </div></custom-spacing> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 2.4  A Data Input Dialog Box</image-tag>
    
    There are two interaction areas within a material data input dialog box:
    the data input table, and a series of action buttons that appear at the bottom.
    Depending on the material item defined, the labels in the table vary, as do
    the number of rows and columns that appear initially. The material item also
    dictates the number of rows and columns that are allowed to be added or
    deleted. In most cases, the columns represent temperatures, and the rows
    represent data values.
    <b>Temperature Dependent Data</b>
    Initially, the table is set up for temperature independent data so the
    temperature field is grayed out. At this point, should the analyst decide to
    enter data for various temperatures, s/he can quickly add columns of text
    fields for the data representing each temperature. The temperature
    dependent data can be added or deleted at any time. There is no necessity
    to predetermine if the data should be temperature dependent.
    
    <b>Adding and Deleting Columns</b>
    In order to add a column, position the text cursor in any field in the
    existing column, then click on the Add Temperature button. A new column
    appears to the right of the existing column, and both temperature fields
    become active, as shown in Fig. 2.5.
    <custom-spacing><div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="./II__Ansys_Operations/5.jpg" alt="image" width="400px"></span>
    </div></custom-spacing> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 2.5  Data Input Dialog Box - Added Column</image-tag>
    
    Then enter the two temperatures and the associated data in the rows.
    More temperature columns can be added, as needed, by following the same
    procedure. Insert columns between existing columns by clicking the text
    cursor in a field within a column that is to the left of where it is nesessary to
    insert the new column, then clicking on the <b>Add Temperature</b> button. A scroll
    bar appears across the bottom of the table when the number of columns
    exceeds the width of the dialog box.
    <b>Adding and Deleting Rows</b>
    It may be necessary to add another row of constants or other data for
    a specific temperature. Then add or delete rows in a similar way as is
    described above for adding or deleting columns. In order to add a row, click
    the text cursor in any field in an existing row, then click on the <b>Add Row (or
    Add Point)</b> button. A new row appears beneath the existing row, as shown
    in Fig. 2.6.
    <custom-spacing><div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="./II__Ansys_Operations/6.jpg" alt="image" width="400px"></span>
    </div></custom-spacing> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 2.6  Data Input Dialog Box - Added Row</image-tag>
    
    <custom-spacing>More rows can be added, as needed, by following the same procedure.
        Insert rows between existing rows by positioning the text cursor in a field in 
        the top row, then clicking on the <b>Add Row (or Add Point)</b> button. 
        A vertical scroll bar appears in the table when the number of rows exceeds 
        the height of the dialog box.</custom-spacing>
    
    <b>Entering/Editing Data in Text Fields</b><br>
    <custom-spacing>When a data dialog box first appears, one of the text fields is 
        selected (black highlight), meaning that the field is ready to accept and display 
        data as the analyst types. The arrow keys can be used to move the selection status 
        to other text fields. Also, pressing the Tab key allows to move the selection status 
        to the text field positioned to the right of the field that is currently selected.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>When the analyst starts typing within a text field, the highlight is 
        replaced by the characters that are typed. The left and right arrow keys can be used 
        to position the text cursor anywhere within the field should it be necessary to replace 
        or delete characters in that field.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>In order to edit data, first select the text field either by clicking on 
        the field, or using the arrow keys to move the selection status to the particular field.</custom-spacing>
    
    <b>Logging/Editing Material Data</b><br>
    <custom-spacing>The <custom-style>Material Models Defined</custom-style> window displays a log 
        of each material model specified. After OK is chosen in the data input dialog box, this 
        window displays a folder icon, and <custom-style>Material Model Number #</custom-style>,
        followed by the properties defined for this model. Additional models can be defined with 
        unique numbers by choosing <custom-process>Material> New Model</custom-process>, then 
        typing a new number in the <custom-style>Define Material ID</custom-style> dialog box.
        On double-clicking on any material model or property, the associated data input dialog 
        box appears where the data can be edited, if chosen.</custom-spacing>
    
    <b>Using Material Library Files</b><br>
    <custom-spacing>Although material properties can be defined separately for each finite element
        analysis, the analyst can also store a material property set in an archival material
        library file, then retrieve the set and reuse it in multiple analyses. Each material 
        property set has its own library file. The material library files also enable several
        users to share commonly used material property data.</custom-spacing>
    
    <sub-heading>2.1.1.5 Creating the Model Geometry</sub-heading><br>
    <custom-spacing>Once material properties are defined, the next step in an analysis is
        generating a finite element model - nodes and elements - that adequately describes the
        model geometry. Figure 2.7 shows some sample finite element models.</custom-spacing>
        <custom-spacing><div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./II__Ansys_Operations/7.jpg" alt="image" width="400px"></span>
        </div></custom-spacing> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 2.7 Sample Finite Element Models</image-tag>
    
    <custom-spacing>There are two methods to create the finite element model: solid
        modeling and direct generation. In <custom-style>solid modeling</custom-style>,
        the analyst describes the geometric shape of model, then instructs the program to 
        automatically <custom-style>mesh</custom-style> the geometry with nodes and elements.
        The size and shape in the elements that the program creates can be controlled. 
        In <custom-style>direct generation</custom-style>, s/he ‘manually’ defines the 
        location of each node and the connectivity of each element. Several convenience 
        operations, such as copying patterns of existing nodes and elements, symmetry 
        reflection, etc. are available.</custom-spacing>
    
    <sub-heading>2.1.2 Applying Loads and Obtaining the Solution</sub-heading><br>
    <custom-spacing>In this step, the SOLUTION processor defines the analysis type and 
        analysis options, apply loads, specify load step options, and initiate the finite 
        element solution. Loads can also be applied via the PREP7 preprocessor.</custom-spacing>
    
    <sub-heading>2.1.2.1 Specifying the Analysis Type and Analysis Options</sub-heading><br>
    <custom-spacing>Specify the analysis type based on the loading conditions and the 
        response to be calculated. For example, if natural frequencies and mode shapes 
        are to be calculated, choose a modal analysis. The following analysis types can be 
        performed in the program: static (or steady-state), transient, harmonic, modal, 
        spectrum, buckling, and substructuring.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>Analysis options allows the analyst to customize the analysis type. 
        Typical analysis options are the method of solution, stress stiffening on or off, 
        and Newton-Raphson options.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>Use <custom-process>Main Menu> Preprocessor> Loads> Analysis Type> New Analysis</custom-process> 
        or <custom-process>Main Menu> Preprocessor> Loads> Analysis Type> Restart</custom-process> 
        to define the analysis type and analysis options.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>The analyst can specify either a new analysis or a restart, but a new a
        analysis is the norm in most cases. A multiframe restart that allows to restart an
        analysis at any point is available for static and transient analyses. The analysis 
        type and analysis options cannot be changed after the first solution.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>After the analysis type and analysis options are defined, the next step 
        is to apply loads. Some structural analysis types require other items to be defined 
        first, such as master degrees of freedom and gap conditions.</custom-spacing>
    
    <sub-heading>2.1.2.2 Applying Loads</sub-heading><br>
    <custom-spacing>The word <custom-style>loads</custom-style> as used in ANSYS includes 
        boundary conditions (constraints, supports, or boundary field specifications) as well 
        as other externally (Fig. 2.8) and internally applied loads. Loads are divided into 
        following categories:</custom-spacing>
    <ul>
        <li>DOF Constraints
        <li>Forces
        <li>Surface Loads
        <li>Body Loads
        <li>Inertia Loads
        <li>Coupled-field Loads
    </ul>
    <custom-spacing><div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="./II__Ansys_Operations/22.png" alt="image" width="500px"></span>
    </div></custom-spacing> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 2.8 External Loads</image-tag>
    
    <custom-spacing>Most of these loads can be applied either on the solid model 
        (keypoints, lines, and areas) or the finite element model (nodes and elements). Two 
        important load-related terms need to be known are load step and substep.
        A <custom-style>load step</custom-style> is simply a configuration of loads for 
        which a solution is to be obtained. In a structural analysis, for example, the 
        analyst may apply wind loads in one load step and gravity in a second load step. 
         steps are also useful in dividing a transient load history curve into several segments.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing><custom-style>Substeps</custom-style> are incremental steps taken 
        within a load step. They are mainly used for accuracy and convergence purposes 
        in transient and nonlinear analyses. Substeps are also known as <custom-style>time steps</custom-style> 
        - steps taken over a period of time.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>The program uses the concept of <custom-style>time</custom-style> 
        in transient analyses as well as static (or steady-state) analyses. In a transient 
        analysis, time represents actual time, in seconds, minutes, or hours. In a static or steady-state analysis, time simply acts as a counter to identify load steps and substeps.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>Loads and boundary conditions can be applied in both the Preprocessor 
        (<custom-process>Main Menu > Preprocessor > Loads > Define Loads > Apply</custom-process>),
         and the Solution processor (<custom-process>Main Menu > Solution > Define Loads > Apply</custom-process>).</custom-spacing>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the kind of constraint to be applied.
        <li>Select the geometric entity on which it is to be applied.
        <li>Enter the value and direction for it.
    </ol>
    <custom-spacing>There is no modify command for loads and B.C.’s. If a mistake is made simply
        apply it again with a new value (the old one will be replaced if it’s on the same entity), 
        or delete it and reapply it.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>Although loads and boundary conditions can be applied to nodes or elements, 
        it’s generally better to apply all B.C.’s to the geometry. When the solve command is issued, 
        they will be automatically transferred to the underlying nodes and elements. If B.C.’s are 
        put on the geometry, that geometry can be remeshed without having to reapply them.</custom-spacing>
    
    <sub-heading>2.1.2.3 Specifying Load Step Options</sub-heading><br>
    <custom-spacing>Load step options are options that the analyst can change from load step 
        to load step, such as number of substeps, time at the end of a load step, and output 
        controls. Depending on the type of analysis s/he is doing, load step options may or may 
        not be required. The analysis procedures in the analysis guide manuals describe the 
        appropriate load step options as necessary.</custom-spacing>
    
    <sub-heading>2.1.2.4 Initiating the Solution</sub-heading><br>
    <custom-spacing>Use <custom-process>Main Menu> Solution> Solve> Current LS</custom-process>
         to initiate solution calculations. When this command is issued, the program takes model 
         and loading information from the database and calculates the results. Results are written
          to the results file (Jobname.RST, Jobname.RTH, or Jobname.RMG) and also to the database.
           The only difference is that only one set of results can reside in the database at one 
           time, while ANSYS can write all sets of results (for all substeps) to the results file.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>Multiple load steps can be solved in a convenient manner using: 
        <custom-process>Main Menu> Solution> Solve> From LS Files</custom-process>.</custom-spacing>
    
    <sub-heading>2.1.3 Reviewing the Results</sub-heading><br>
    <custom-spacing>After the solution has been calculated, use the postprocessors to review the 
        results. Two postprocessors are available: POST1 and POST26.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>Use <custom-style>POST1</custom-style>, the general postprocessor, to review 
        results at one substep (time step) over the entire model or selected portion of the model. 
        The GUI path for entering POST1 is <custom-process>Main Menu> General Postproc</custom-process>, 
        valid only at the Begin level. The analyst can obtain contour displays, deformed shapes, and tabular 
        listings to review and interpret the results of the analysis. POST1 offers many other capabilities, 
        including error estimation, load case combinations, calculations among results data, and path operations.</custom-spacing><br>
    <custom-spacing>Use <custom-style>POST26</custom-style>, the time-history postprocessor, to review 
        results at specific points in the model over all time steps. The GUI path for entering POST26 
        is <custom-process>Main Menu> TimeHist Postpro</custom-process>, valid only at the Begin level. 
        Graph plots of results data versus time (or frequency) and tabular listings can be obtained.</custom-spacing>
