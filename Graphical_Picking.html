    <custom-heading level="2">1.6 Graphical Picking</custom-heading level='2'><br>
        Many functions in the ANSYS program involve graphical picking - using
        the mouse to identify model entities and coordinate locations. There are three
        types of graphical picking operations:
        <ul>
            <li><custom-style>Locational</custom-style> picking, where the coordinates of a new point are located.</li>
            <li><custom-style>Retrieval</custom-style> picking, where existing entities are identified for subsequent
            operations.</li>
            <li><custom-style>Query</custom-style> picking, where points are identified on the model for querying
            data.</li>
        </ul>
        <custom-spacing>Mouse Button Assignments for Picking</custom-spacing><br>
        Mouse button assignments during any picking operation are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>The left button picks or unpicks the entity or location closest to the
            mouse pointer. When this button is pressed, the analyst can cross-
            examine the entity numbers before they are picked, and thus
            query data. Press and drag the left mouse button to preview the
            item being picked or unpicked.</li>
            <li>The middle button (shift-right button on a two-button mouse) is
            the same as the <custom-process>Apply</custom-process> button on the picker. A number of items
            can be picked, and no operations will take effect until <custom-process>Apply</custom-process> or
            <custom-process>OK</custom-process> is pressed. If there are no items currently picked, the middle
            button closes the picker.</li>
            <li>The right button toggles between pick and unpick mode. This
            button is the same as the <custom-process>Pick</custom-process> and <custom-process>Unpick</custom-process> toggle buttons on the
            picking menu.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <custom-spacing>Hot Spots</custom-spacing><br>
        Hot spots are the locations on an entity that identify it for retrieval
        picking. For example, if two elements are adjacent, the element that is picked
        is the one whose hot spot is closest to the mouse pointer. For areas, volumes,
        and elements, the hot spot is at a location near the centroid. Lines have three
        hot spots: one in the middle and one near each end.<br>
        If the hot spots of two or more entities are coincident, picking the
        coincident entities brings up a <custom-process>"Multiple Entities"</custom-process> dialog box (Fig. 1.29). Press
        the <custom-process>Next</custom-process> or <custom-process>Prev</custom-process> button to <custom-style>"cycle through"</custom-style> the coincident entities until the
        desired entity is highlighted. Then click <custom-process>OK</custom-process> to pick that entity.<br>

        <sub-heading>1.6.1 Locational and Retrieval Picking</sub-heading><br>
        Whenever graphical picking (clicking on a menu topic ending with
        the + symbol) is used, the GUI brings up a picking menu, sometimes known
        as the picker. Figure 1.30 shows the picking menus for locational and retrieval
        picking. In this example, creating keypoints by picking their locations on the
        working plane is a locational picking operation, and picking those keypoints to
        apply a load on them is a retrieval picking operation.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/32.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.30 Picking Menus for Locational and Retrieval Picking</image-tag><br>
        <ul>
            <li><custom-process>Function Title</custom-process> - Identifies the function being performed.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Pick Mode</custom-process> - Allows to pick or unpick a location or entity. Either these
            toggle buttons or the right mouse button can be used to switch
            between pick and unpick modes. The mouse pointer is shown as an up
            arrow for picking and a down arrow for unpicking.</li>
            For retrieval picking, choose among single, box, polygon, circle, and
            loop mode. In single pick mode, each click on the mouse picks one entity.
            With box, polygon, and circle modes, press and drag the mouse to enclose a
            set of entities in a box, polygon, or circle.<br>
            Loop mode is available for picking lines and areas only. With loop
            mode, when the analyst picks on a line, then the complete set of lines (or
            areas) defining a continuous loop including that line is also picked. This
            feature is useful when it is necessary to identify continuous lines in order to
            make an area. For all modes of retrieval picking, ANSYS shows the picked
            entities highlighted for visual clarity.<br>
            <li><custom-process>Pick Status</custom-process> - Shows the number of items picked ("Count") and the
            minimum and maximum number of picks required for the function.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Picked Data</custom-process> - Shows information about the item being picked. For
            locational picking, the working plane and global Cartesian coordinates
            of the point are shown. For retrieval picking, this area shows the entity
            number. This data can be seen by pressing and dragging the mouse in
            the graphics area. This allows to preview the information before
            releasing the mouse button and picking the item.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Keyboard Entry Options</custom-process> - In some cases, it may be necessary to
            enter the required data by keyboard in the picker. For example, to
            specify a known coordinate location during locational picking, it may be
            easier to enter the coordinates than to use the mouse. In that case,
            the analyst can choose between working plane coordinates and global
            Cartesian coordinates. For retrieval picking, choose between entering a
            list of entity numbers (such as 1,21,343,...) and a range of numbers
            (such as 1,21,2).</li>
            <li><custom-process>Action Buttons</custom-process> - This area of the menu contains buttons that take
            action on the picked entities, as follows:
            <custom-process>OK</custom-process> - Applies the picked items to execute the function and closes the picking
            menu.<br>
            <custom-process>Apply</custom-process> - Applies the picked items to execute the function but does not close
            the picking menu. Use this button on the menu or stay in the graphics area
            and click the middle mouse button to apply.<br>
            <custom-process>Reset</custom-process> - Unpicks all picked entities and restores the menu and the graphics
            area to their state at the last Apply.<br>
            <custom-process>Cancel</custom-process> - Cancels the function and closes the picking menu.<br>
            <custom-process>Pick All</custom-process> - Picks all entities, executes the selected function, and closes the
            picking menu. This feature is available for retrieval picking only.<br>
            <custom-process>Help</custom-process> - Brings up help information for the function being performed.</li>
        </ul>
        <sub-heading>1.6.2 Query Picking</sub-heading><br>
        The picker can be used to <custom-style>"Query"</custom-style> data on the model at any time
        during the analysis. Querying means that, for any picked point on the model,
        ANSYS will retrieve or calculate specified items from the database and display
        them. This information can be displayed in an output window, or it can be
        applied to the model as 3-D annotation. Query picking is a retrieval picking
        function, with the selection box items varying according to the requested
        data. The model and results query pickers are discussed in the following
        sections.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.6.2.1 The Model Query Picker</sub-heading><br>
        The model query picker allows to access model information by picking
        displayed entities. It also performs basic computations to provide simple
        geometric/loading information. The model query picker can be used to obtain
        information about the model while building it. This is helpful when building on
        to an existing model, or for applying forces or loads that are dependent on
        the model data. The model query picker can be accessed by choosing <custom-process>Utility
        Menu> List> Picked Entities</custom-process>, at any time during the analysis.<br>
        <custom-spacing>Annotation</custom-spacing><br>
        When the model query picker is used to obtain model information,
        ANSYS displays the information in a text window. That information can also
        be applied to the model as 3-D annotation by checking the <custom-process>"Generate 3D
        Anno"</custom-process> box on the picker. The annotation is applied with the appropriate units
        displayed, and arrows and leaders are attached where necessary. 3-D
        annotation, unlike 2-D, will attempt to retain the proper positioning on the
        appropriate entities, even when the model is rotated or resized.<br>
        The overall 3-D dimensions of the model are defined by a bounding
        box. If portions of the model's bounding box lie outside of the visible area of
        the graphics window, it can affect the placement of the 3-D annotations.
        Zooming out will usually overcome this problem.<br>
        Modify query annotation using <custom-process>Utility Menu> PlotCtrls> Annotation>
        Create 3D Annotation</custom-process>. Select <custom-process>"Options"</custom-process> to modify the typeface and move,
        copy, or resize the annotation.<br>
        <custom-spacing>Action Buttons</custom-spacing><br>
        <ul>
            <li><custom-process>OK</custom-process> - Enters all query data and either displays it in a window or applies
            it to the model. The model query picker is then closed.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Apply</custom-process> - Enters all query data and displays it in a window or applies it to
            the model. The model query picker is left open for additionals
            operations.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Reset</custom-process> - Clears all query data.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Cancel</custom-process> - Clears all query data and closes the model query picker.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Pick All</custom-process> - Accesses all of the selected query items on the model.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Help</custom-process> - Brings up this screen of help information.</li>
        </ul>
        <custom-spacing>Tips on Using the Model Query Picker</custom-spacing><br>
        The model query picker is accessible at any time during the analysis. It
        is useful for determining model database information that would require hand
        calculations to determine. The computations performed by the picker are not
        displayed until <custom-process>OK</custom-process> or <custom-process>APPLY</custom-process> is pressed.<br>
        The items selected by the picker are highlighted before they are
        actually selected. Hold the left mouse button down and move the pointer
        around the model to ensure that the proper entity is selected. The analyst can
        select multiple items, with no computations being performed or annotation
        applied until <custom-process>OK</custom-process> is clicked. The commands and operations performed by the
        model query picker are not written to the log file.<br>
        The annotation that is generated during the preprocessing stage can
        be displayed at any time during the analysis. This information is not modified
        or updated during the course of the analysis, and can become invalid. For
        instance, when a shape is deformed by the applied forces, the area and
        volume annotations created before applying the force will not change, and
        the information displayed may be incorrect.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.6.2.2 The Results Query Picker</sub-heading><br>
        The most convenient way to review results for specific points on the
        model is by using the results query picker. Querying means that, for any
        picked point on the model, the ANSYS program will retrieve a specified results
        data value from the database and display it. Access the results query picker
        by choosing <custom-process>Main Menu> General Postproc> Query Results</custom-process>. The analyst can
        query nodal or element solution data.<br>
        When this GUI path is choosen, the results query picker for element
        solution data appears. This menu has most of the same items as the
        locational and retrieval picking menus:
        <ul>
            <li><custom-process>Function Title</custom-process> - Identifies the information being queried; either nodal,
            element, or subgrid solution data.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Pick Mode</custom-process> - Allows to pick or unpick a location on the model to be
            queried. These toggle buttons or the right mouse button can be used
            to switch between pick and unpick modes. The mouse pointer is shown
            as an up arrow for picking and a down arrow for unpicking.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Picked Location</custom-process> - Shows the number and location of the node,
            element, or subgrid point being picked for query. This information can
            be previewed by pressing and dragging the mouse in the graphics
            area. The picked location is highlighted on the model as a square on
            the displaced shape.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Queried Data</custom-process> - Shows the queried solution data for the node, element,
            or subgrid point at the picked location. Use the <custom-process>Max</custom-process> or <custom-process>Min</custom-process> buttons to
            automatically obtain the maximum or minimum value of the query data
            over the entire model.</li>
        </ul>
        <custom-spacing>Annotation</custom-spacing><br>
        The results query picker retrieves solution data from the database and
        displays it in a text window. That information can be applied to the model as
        3-D annotation by selecting the <custom-process>“Generate 3D Anno”</custom-process> box on the picker. The
        annotation is applied with the appropriate units displayed, and arrows and
        leaders are attached where necessary. The overall 3-D dimensions of the
        model are defined by a bounding box. If portions of the model's bounding box
        lie outside of the visible area of the graphics window, it can affect the
        placement of the 3-D annotations. Zooming out will usually overcome this
        problem. Unlike the model query picker, the results query picker displays the
        actual data on the model as the mouse pointer is moved over the different
        entities. This function is available only from the <custom-processor>General Postprocessor</custom-processor>.<br>
        <custom-spacing>Action Buttons</custom-spacing><br>
        <ul>
            <li><custom-process>OK</custom-process> - Clears all query data and closes the results query picker.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Apply</custom-process> - Clears all query data and brings up the Query Solution Data
            dialog box again. This button can be used on the picking menu or stay
            in the graphics area and click the middle mouse button to achieve the
            same effect.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Reset</custom-process> - Clears all query data.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Cancel</custom-process> - Clears all query data and closes the query picking menu.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Min</custom-process> - Shows the minimum value of the query data over the entire
            model.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Max</custom-process> - Shows the maximum value of the query data over the entire
            model.</li>
            <li><custom-process>Help</custom-process> - Brings up this screen of help information.</li>
