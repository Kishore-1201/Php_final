    <custom-heading level="2">1.3 Mechanical APDL Environment</custom-heading><br>
    There are two basic levels in ANSYS - Begin level and Processor level.
    The <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor> acts as a doorway into and out of the program. It is also used
    for performing operations such as changing the jobname, clearing the
    database, and copying binary files. When the analyst first enters the program,
    s/he is at the <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor>.
    At the <custom-processor>Processor level</custom-processor>, many processors are available. Each processor
    is a set of functions that performs a specific analysis task. The model is built
    in the general preprocessor (PREP7). Loads are applied and the solution is
    obtained in the solution processor (SOLUTION). The results of a solution are
    assessed in the general postprocessor (POST1). An additional postprocessor,
    POST26, permits to evaluate solution results at specific points in the model as
    a function of time.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.1 Entering a Processor</sub-heading><br>
    Select a processor to enter it from the Main Menu of the GUI. Choose
    <custom-process>Main Menu> Preprocessor</custom-process> to enter into PREP7.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.2 Exiting from a Processor or from the Program</sub-heading><br>
    Pick <custom-process>Main Menu> Finish</custom-process> to return to the <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor> from a processor.
    Without returning to the <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor>, the user can move from one processor
    to another. Simply pick the processor necessary to do so.
    <custom-spacing>Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Exit</custom-process> to leave ANSYS. By default, ANSYS
    saves the model and loads automatically and writes them to the database
    file, Jobname.DB. If a backup of the current database file already exists,
    ANSYS writes it to Jobname.DBB. Other portions of the database can be
    saved using options in the dialog box. The user can as well quit without
    saving.<br></custom-spacing>
    In order to input a new file, select <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Clear & Start
    New</custom-process> to clear the current file from memory, then select a file to input. In order
    to return to processing the original file, select <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Read
    Input from...</custom-process>, select the name of the file to resume from and select
    the <custom-process>OK</custom-process>button.
    <custom-spacing>The processing of an input file can be stopped as it is being input. Most
    files will display the Process Status window at the top of the screen. Use
    the <custom-process>STOP</custom-process> button on the Process Status window to terminate the input of a
    file. Stopping file input is useful when a binary file is input unintentionally.<br></custom-spacing>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3 The Database</sub-heading><br>
    ANSYS stores all input data and results data in one large database in
    an structured manner. The main advantage of the database is any specific
    data item can quickly and easily be listed, displayed, modified, or deleted.
    No matter which processor the analyst is in, s/he works with the same
    database. This gives basic access to the model and loads portions of the
    database from anywhere in the program. "Basic access" refers the ability to
    select, list, or display an item.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3.1 Defining or Deleting Database Items</sub-heading><br>
    The analyst must be in the right processor to define or delete items
    from the database. Nodes, elements, and other geometry can be defined
    only in PREP7, the general preprocessor. Loads can be specified and applied
    in either the PREP7 or the SOLUTION processor. However, geometry items
    can be selected, listed, or displayed from anywhere in ANSYS.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3.2 Saving the Database</sub-heading><br>
    The analyst should frequently save copies of database to a file as it
    contains all the input data. Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Save as Jobname.DB</custom-process> to
    do this. This choice writes the database to the file Jobname.DB. <custom-process>SAVE</custom-process>
    command has the following options:
    <ul>
        <li>the model data only</li>
        <li>the model and solution data</li>
        <li>the model, solution and preprocessing data.</li>
    </ul>
    Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Save as</custom-process> to specify a different file name. Any
    save operation first writes a backup of the present database file
    to Jobname.DBB. If a Jobname.DBB file already exists, the new backup file
    overwrites it.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3.3 Restoring Database Contents</sub-heading><br>
    Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Resume Jobname.DB</custom-process> to restore data from
    the database file. This reads the file Jobname.DB. Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File>
    Resume from</custom-process> to specify a different file name.
    The database can be saved or resumed from anywhere in ANSYS,
    including the <custom-processor>Begin level</custom-processor>. A resume operation replaces the data currently in
    memory with the data in the named database file. Using the save and resume
    operations together is helpful when "testing" a function or command.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.3.4 Session Editor</sub-heading><br>
    During an analysis, it may be necessary to modify or delete commands
    entered since the last <custom-process>SAVE</custom-process> or <custom-process>RESUME</custom-process>. The session editor is used for
    displaying and editing the sequence of operations performed since the last
    <custom-process>SAVE</custom-process> or <custom-process>RESUME</custom-process> command. The analyst can modify command parameters,
    delete whole sections of text or save a portion of the command string to a
    separate file. The session editor (Fig. 1.4) can be accessed by choosing
    <custom-process>Main Menu> Session Editor</custom-process>.<br>
    <div class="container-1">
        <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/4.jpg" alt="image" width="150"></span>
        <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/5.jpg" alt="image" width="300"></span>
    </div> 
    <image-tag>Fig. 1.4 The Session Editor</image-tag><br>

    The following file operations are available in the session editor:
    <ul>
        <li>OK: Enters the series of operations displayed in the window below.
        Use this option to input the command sequence after modifying it</li>
        <li>Save: Saves the command sequence displayed in the window
        below to a separate file. The program names the
        file Jobnam000.cmds, with each subsequent save operation
        incrementing the filename by one digit The INPUT command is
        used to reenter the saved file</li>
        <li>Cancel: Dismisses this window and returns to the program</li>
        <li>Help: Displays the command reference for the UNDO command.</li>
    </ul>
    The Session Editor is available in GUI mode only. It is a powerful
    ANSYS Undo. ANSYS keeps a running copy of the log file from the last save
    command. By modifying the values in the Session Editor window and clicking
    OK, the modified commands are read back into ANSYS. If
    no SAVE or RESUME command has been issued during the analysis, all
    commands from the current session will be executed, including
    the start160.ans file, if present.<br>

    <sub-heading>1.3.3.5 Clearing the Database</sub-heading><br>
    In building a model, sometimes it may be necessary to clear out the
    database contents and start afresh. Choose <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Clear &
    Start New</custom-process> to do so. This method clears the database stored in memory.
    Clearing the database has the same effect as leaving and re-entering the
    program, but does not require to exit.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.4 Program Files</sub-heading><br>
    The program writes and reads many files for data storage and
    retrieval. File names follow this pattern: Name.Ext. Name defaults to the
    jobname, which the analyst specifies while entering the program or by
    choosing <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Change Jobname</custom-process>. The default jobname
    is FILE (or file). Ext is a unique, two- to four-character identifier that
    identifies the contents of the file. For example, Jobname.DB is the database
    file, Jobname.EMAT is the element matrix file, and Jobname.GRPH is the
    neutral graphics file.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.4.1 File Types</sub-heading><br>
    The filename can contain up to 248 characters, including the directory
    name, and the extension can contain up to eight characters. ANSYS can
    process blanks in file or directory names, so blank spaces are permitted in
    object names. When an object has a blank space in its name, always enclose
    the name in a pair of single quotes.
    Use back slashes (\) instead of (/) slashes in directory names. For
    example, a typical directory path looks like this:
    <image-tag>C:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\ANSYS
    Student\v201\ANSYS\apdl\start.ans</image-tag><br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.4.2 The Jobname.LOG File</sub-heading><br>
    The Jobname.LOG file (the session log) is mainly important, as it
    provides a complete log of the session. This file opens immediately when the
    analyst enters ANSYS, and it records all commands executed. S/he can read
    the Jobname.LOG file, view it while in ANSYS, edit it, and input it later.<br>
    The program always appends log data to the log file instead of
    overwriting it. If the analyst changes the jobname while in a session, the log
    file name does not change to the new jobname.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5 Communicating with ANSYS</sub-heading><br>
    The easiest way to communicate with the ANSYS is by using the
    intuitive menu system, called the GUI.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5.1 Communicating via the GUI</sub-heading><br>
    The GUI consists of windows, menus, dialog boxes and other
    components that permits to feed input data and execute functions simply by
    picking buttons with a mouse or typing in responses to prompts. All users,
    both beginner and advanced, find it convenient to use the GUI for interactive
    work.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5.2 Communicating Via Commands</sub-heading><br>
    Commands are the instructions that instruct the program. The
    program offers numerous commands, each meant for a specific function. Most
    commands are allied with specific processors, and work in respective
    processor(s). The analyst can either type in the appropriate command or
    access that function from the GUI to use it.
    Program commands have a specific format. A typical command consists
    of a command name in the first field, usually followed by a comma and
    several more fields (containing arguments). A comma separates each field.
    For example, the F command, which applies a force at a node, looks like this:
    F commmand
    <image-tag>F,NODE,Lab,VALUE</image-tag>
    To apply an X-direction force of 2000 at node number 376, the F command
    would read as follows:
    <image-tag>F,376,FX,2000</image-tag>
    Command arguments may take a number or an alphanumeric labels,
    depending on their function. In the F command example described
    previously, NODE and VALUE are numeric arguments, but Lab is an
    alphanumeric argument. In this book, numeric arguments appear in all
    uppercase italic letters (as in NODE and VALUE), and alphanumeric arguments
    appear in initial uppercase italic format (as in Lab).<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5.3 Abbreviations</sub-heading><br>
    If a GUI function is used frequently, it can be renamed or abbreviated
    to a string of up to eight alphanumeric characters using: <custom-process>Utility Menu>
    Macro> Edit Abbreviations</custom-process> or <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Edit Toolbar</custom-process>. In
    the GUI, abbreviations appear as push buttons on the Toolbar. They can be
    executed with a quick click of the mouse.<br>
    <sub-heading>1.3.5.4 Command Macro Files</sub-heading><br>
    A frequently used sequence of commands can be recorded in a macro
    file, thus creating a custom command. If an unrecognized command is
    entered, the program searches for a macro file by that name (with an
    extension of .MAC or .mac).<br>
