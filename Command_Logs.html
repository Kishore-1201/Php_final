    <custom-heading level="2">1.8 Using the ANSYS Session and Command Logs</custom-heading level='2'><br>
        The ANSYS program records every command it executes, at two
        places: the session log file and the internal database command log.<br>
        The session log file is a text file which is saved in the working directory.
        The database command log is saved in the ANSYS database. This log can be
        copied to a file at any time by choosing <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Write DB Log
        File</custom-process>. Both files are command logs that can be used as input to the ANSYS
        program.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.8.1 Session Log File</sub-heading><br>
        Every ANSYS session produces a session log named Jobname.LOG.
        Jobname is determined by the jobname defined at ANSYS entry. The default
        jobname is <custom-style>FILE</custom-style> or file, depending on the operating system. The program
        opens the log file when the analyst first enters the program, and closes it
        when s/he exits the program.<br>
        The session log file provides a complete record of the ANSYS session in
        terms of commands and is quite valuable as a means of recovering from a
        system crash or catastrophic user mistake. By reading in a renamed copy of
        the log file or by submitting it as a batch file, the s/he can re-execute every
        command in the log file, recreating the database exactly as it existed
        previously. The log file is also useful as a debugging tool that can help to
        reveal any mistakes that might have been made in an ANSYS session.<br>
        Each new ANSYS session appends commands to the existing
        file Jobname.LOG. That is, the log file is not overwritten during a new ANSYS
        session, but added to. A <custom-style>"time stamp,"</custom-style> consisting of the current date and
        time, is included so that the analyst can identify the start of each session. The
        entire log file can be listed during an interactive run by picking <custom-process>Utility Menu>
        List> Files> Log File</custom-process>. Because this file is in ASCII format, it can be viewed
        and edited readily using an external text editor.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.8.2 Using the Database Command Log</sub-heading><br>
        ANSYS captures commands generated during an ANSYS session not
        only in the log file but also in memory. This in-memory version of the
        command history is called the internal database log. When the database is
        saved, the program saves this command log in the database file
        (Jobname.DB) along with the other database information.<br>
        Use <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Write DB Log File</custom-process> to write the database
        command log to a named ASCII file. Then edit this file, make desired
        changes, and use the file as command input to the program. This capability is
        especially useful to use the command history that was created during an
        interactive session, but have somehow lost or corrupted the session log file
        (Jobname.LOG) that was associated with the database.<br>
        If the database is created in multiple sessions by saving and resuming
        the database file, the ANSYS program keeps the database log continuous by
        appending each new command that is processed. Therefore, the internal
        database log is not fragmented; it will represent the complete database.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.8.3 Command Log File as Input</sub-heading><br>
        The procedure for re-executing the commands contained in
        a Jobname.LOG file or in the database log consists of three main steps:
        1. Establish the command log file
        2. Edit the command log file as desired
        3. Read the edited file into the ANSYS session.<br>
        <custom-spacing><b>Step 1: Establish the Command Log File</b></custom-spacing><br>
        The method to do this depends on whether the analyst uses the
        session log file or the database log.<br>
        <custom-spacing><b>Session Log File</b></custom-spacing><br>
        Perform the following steps to establish a command log file from the
        session log file, (Jobname.LOG):<br>
        1. Rename or copy the session log file to a different name. This can be
        done at the system level or from within the program.<br>
        2. List the log file by choosing <custom-process>Utility Menu> List> Files> Log File</custom-process>.<br>
        3. Choose <custom-process>File> Save as</custom-process> from the Log File window.<br>
        <custom-spacing><b>Database Command Log</b></custom-spacing><br>
        Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Write DB Log File</custom-process> to establish a command
        log file from the database log. A file name can be specified or the default
        name, Jobname.LGW can be executed.<br>
        <custom-spacing><b>Step 2: Edit the Command Log File</b><br></custom-spacing>
        <custom-spacing>Sometimes, it is necessary to edit the command log file before using it
        as program input. As the analyst edits the log file, s/he may want to add
        comments or indentation to improve its readability. Comments can be added
        to the log file by using comment commands or by using the comment</custom-spacing>
        character (!).<br>
        <custom-spacing><b>Step 3: Read in the Edited Log File</b></custom-spacing><br>
        Pick <custom-process>Utility Menu> File> Read Input</custom-process> fromÂ  to read in the edited
        command log file.
