     <custom-heading level="2">1.7 Customizing the GUI</custom-heading level='2'><br>
        The GUI allows several levels of customization, ranging from a simple
        change in the sizes of the GUI and the areas in it to a more complex change
        in the menu hierarchy and design of the dialog boxes. GUI attributes which
        can be changed include the following items:
        <ul>
            <li>The size of the GUI and the areas in it</li>
            <li>Colors and fonts</li>
            <li>The menus shown at GUI start-up</li>
            <li>The mouse and keyboard focus</li>
            <li>The menu hierarchy and dialog boxes.</li>
        </ul>
        <sub-heading>1.7.1 Changing the GUI Layout</sub-heading><br>
        The ANSYS toolbar, Main Menu, and Graphics Window, as well as the
        overall size of the GUI can be resized. To resize the areas in the GUI, drag
        one of the borders around the areas of the GUI while holding down the left
        mouse button.<br>
        In order to change the overall size of the GUI, position the mouse on
        one of the corners of the GUI and drag it diagonally toward the center of the
        GUI while holding down the left mouse button. GUI size settings can be saved
        by selecting <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Save Menu Layout</custom-process>.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.7.2 Changing Colors and Fonts</sub-heading><br>
        The system-level fonts determine the default ANSYS GUI font
        component. ANSYS uses the fonts that are set at the <custom-process>Display
        Properties</custom-process> system level. The fonts in the ANSYS GUI are based on the system
        font settings. Use the <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Font</custom-process> dialog to modify the
        GUI fonts. Once these settings are changed, use the <custom-process>Utility Menu>
        MenuCtrls> Save Menu Layout</custom-process> to save the settings. The saved settings will
        override the system fonts and become the ANSYS default.<br>
        The Main Menu fonts can also be modified by using the <custom-process>“right mouse
        button”</custom-process> - preferences function. At this level, specific fonts and colors are set
        in the Main Menu at a functional level. The analyst can change the overall
        fonts, and change the colors according to the progressive level as s/he opens
        the nested menu items.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.7.3 Changing the GUI Components Shown at Start-Up</sub-heading><br>
        By default, the main areas of the GUI (Utility Menu, Main Menu,
        Standard Toolbar, ANSYS Toolbar, Input Window, Graphics Window, and
        Output Window) display when the GUI is activated.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.7.4 Changing the Mouse and Keyboard Focus</sub-heading><br>
        The ANSYS program uses the concept of input focus to determine
        which window on the screen is active; that is, which window receives input
        from the mouse and the keyboard. A window may have implicit focus (also
        known as pointer focus), in which case moving the mouse pointer into that
        window makes it active. With explicit focus, it is necessary to move the
        pointer into the window and click the left button for that window to be active.<br>
        The ANSYS GUI also gives automatic keyboard focus to the Input
        Window. This means a command can be entered without first moving the
        mouse into the Input Window. If a dialog box is brought up, then keyboard
        focus is automatically redirected to it so the analyst can enter data without
        moving the mouse. This feature is sometimes called the <custom-style>hot keyboard</custom-style> feature.<br>
