        <custom-heading level="2">1.5 GUI</custom-heading level='2'><br>
        The GUI is an easy and intuitive way to interact with the program. The
        GUI mode is often referred to as interactive mode. The GUI allows to perform
        an analysis interactively with little or no knowledge of individual commands.
        Each GUI option activates one or more commands to perform the requested
        operation. Most operations can be performed interactively, but some
        operations are available only by entering commands in the command input
        area or via a batch file. The program records all commands issued in the
        input history file (Jobname.LOG).<br>
    
        ANSYS can be run through the GUI and commands input window, or
        by creating an ASCII text file for input, or both. It is often more desirable to
        use a combination of both graphical methods and input files. An input file is
        often useful for defining the initial model geometry, characteristics, and
        constraints. This is because the input file can be easily changed to correct the
        errors that are inevitable when setting up a new ANSYS model. Once the
        input is correct and the model geometry and material characteristics are read
        into ANSYS, it is then desirable to examine the results using either direct
        command input with the command input window, or the graphical menu
        selections.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.5.1 GUI Components</sub-heading><br>
        Dialog boxes are used to provide input for a particular function. The
        type of dialog box provided depends on the type of input required. The input
        might require any of the following: text entry box, check button, radio button,
        option button, single-selection list, multiple-selection list, two-column
        selection list, a tabbed box, or a tree structure. Other components of a dialog
        box include action buttons such as OK, Apply, and Cancel.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.5.1.1 Text Entry Boxes</sub-heading><br>
        In a text entry box (Fig. 1.7) numbers or character strings are
        entered. If text already exists in the text entry box, overwrite it by
        highlighting the existing text. Press and drag the left mouse button to
        highlight existing text. Double-clicking the left mouse button on a word
        highlights the word, and triple-clicking it highlights the entire string.<br>

        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.7 Text Entry Box</image-tag><br>
    
        <sub-heading>1.5.1.2 Check Buttons</sub-heading><br>
        Check buttons are square buttons that enable or disable features. Click
        on it with the left mouse button to change a check button from ON to OFF or
        vice versa. The buttons under "Preferences for GUI Filtering" (Fig. 1.8) are
        check buttons.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/9.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>

        <image-tag>Fig. 1.8 Check and Radio Buttons</image-tag><br>
    
        <sub-heading>1.5.1.3 Radio Buttons</sub-heading><br>
        Radio buttons are diamond shaped buttons used to select one of
        several options. One button is always "On" in a set of radio buttons. Clicking
        on the desired item makes that button active and turns off other buttons. The
        buttons shown under "Structural discipline options" (Fig. 1.8) are radio
        buttons.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.5.1.4 Option Buttons</sub-heading><br>
        With option buttons (Fig. 1.9) the analyst selects an item from a pop-
        up menu that collapses into one button showing the active choice. Adopt the
        following procedure to select a different option:
        1. Place the cursor on the button
        2. Press the left mouse button and hold it
        3. Drag the mouse through the pop-up menu until the desired item is
        highlighted.<br>

        <sub-heading>1.5.1.5 Single-Selection Lists</sub-heading><br>
        A single-selection list (Fig. 1.10) is used to select one option from a
        scrollable list. Clicking on the desired item highlights it and copies it to the
        Selection box, where it can be edited.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/11.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>

        <image-tag>Fig. 1.10 Example of a Single-Selection List</image-tag><br>
    
        <sub-heading>1.5.1.6 Multiple-Selection Lists</sub-heading><br>
        A multiple-selection list (Fig. 1.11) is used to select items from a list. It
        resembles the single-selection list except that there is no Selection box, and
        more than one item can be selected. Clicking on an item highlights and makes
        it active, and clicking the same item again deactivates it.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/12.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.11 Multiple-Selection List</image-tag><br>
    
        <sub-heading>1.5.1.7 Two-Column Selection Lists</sub-heading><br>
        One of several choices can be selected from a two-column selection list
        (Fig. 1.12). It resembles the single-selection list except the choices are
        grouped into categories. Select a category from the left column, then pick the
        desired item from the right column. Choices available in the right column vary
        according to the choice in the left column.
        The GUI displays this type of list primarily when it is necessary to
        select from a large number of items.<br>

        <sub-heading>1.5.1.8 Tabbed Dialog Boxes</sub-heading><br>
        A tabbed dialog box (Fig. 1.13) presents groups of related commands
        in one location. Select an individual tab by clicking on it, or by
        using Ctrl+Tab to move between the tabs. Some tabbed dialog boxes require
        that the analyst navigates through each tab sequentially, with later tabs
        “grayed out” until s/he completes required tasks in an earlier tab.<br>
        <div class="container-1">

        <sub-heading>1.5.1.9 Drop-Down List Boxes</sub-heading><br>
        A drop-down list box (Fig. 1.14) provides a list of choices for an option.
        Make a selection by clicking on the small arrow on the right side of the list
        box and then scrolling to and clicking on the desired choice from the list.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/15.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>

        <sub-heading>1.5.1.10 Tree Structures</sub-heading><br>
        A tree structure (Fig. 1.15) presents a hierarchical flow of logical
        choices from major categories to specific subcategories. Select a major
        category by double-clicking on the category. Subcategories appear listed
        vertically and indented beneath that major category. If a subcategory is
        selected in the same way, further subcategories are listed, and become more
        specific. Continually selecting subcategories yields the final item in the
        “branch” of the tree. At this point, instead of a categorical choice, enter or
        edit data to provide specific input.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/16.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.15 Tree Structures</image-tag><br>
    
        Double-click on the name of the final item to display a data input
        dialog box (Fig. 1.16) where the data is entered or edited.<br>
        <div class="container-1">

        <sub-heading>1.5.1.11 Using Action Buttons</sub-heading><br>
        A dialog box typically contains combinations of the following action
        buttons:
        <ul>
            <li>OK - Applies the changes and closes the dialog box.</li>
            <li>Apply - Applies changes but does not close the dialog box. Use this
            button when it is necessary to make more than one change within a
            dialog box, or when it is necessary to execute a function more than
            once.</li>
            <li>Reset - The settings in the dialog box revert to the previous or default
            settings.</li>
            <li>Cancel - Closes the dialog box without applying any changes made.
            The difference between Cancel and Reset is that Reset does not
            close the dialog box.</li>
            <li>Help - Displays help information for the function being performed.</li>
        </ul>
        <sub-heading>1.5.2 Layout of the GUI</sub-heading><br>
        If the analyst enters the program through the launcher, the GUI is
        activated automatically for interactive running. The GUI (Fig. 1.17) has seven
        areas:<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/18.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.17 The Program GUI replace</image-tag><br>
        1. <b>Utility Menu</b> - Contains functions that are available throughout the
        ANSYS session, such as file controls, selections, graphic controls and
        parameters. The analyst can also exit the program through this menu.
        <br>2. <b>Standard Toolbar</b> - Contains push buttons that execute commonly
        used ANSYS commands. More push buttons can be added if desired.
        <br>3. <b>Command Input Area</b> - Shows program prompt messages and
        allows analyst to type in commands directly.
        <br>4. <b>Main Menu</b> - Contains the primary ANSYS functions, organized by
        preprocessor, solution, general postprocessor, design optimizer. It is
        from this menu that the vast majority of modelling commands are
        issued.
        <br>5. <b>Graphics Window</b> - The Graphic Window is where graphics are
        shown and graphical picking can be made. It is here where analyst will
        graphically view the model in its various stages of construction and the
        ensuing results from the analysis.
        <br>6. <b>Status and Prompt Area</b> - located at the bottom of the GUI, shows
        prompts and the status of the analysis. Typically, prompts for functions
        that involve graphical picking will be seen. Be sure to read the prompt
        so the proper entities can be picked in the proper order. This area also
        contains status information.
        <br>7. <b>Output Window</b> - The Output Window (Fig. 1.18) shows text output
        from the program, such as listing of data etc. It is usually positioned
        behind the main window and can be put to the front if necessary.
        The GUI is fairly easy to use. There is some terminology related to
        basic operation:<br>
    
        <custom-spacing><custom-style>Resume:</custom-style> Resume opens a previously saved database. Resuming a
        database doesn’t change the jobname. For example: start ANSYS with
        a jobname of file. Then resume example.db, do some work, then save.
        That save is done to file.db! This can be avoided by always resuming
        using the <img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/19.jpg" alt="image">icon on the toolbar. If example.db is opened using this
        method, it resumes the model and automatically changes the jobname
        to example.</custom-spacing>
        <custom-spacing><custom-style>Plotting:</custom-style> Contrary to the name, this has nothing to do with sending an
        image to a plotter or printer. Plotting in ANSYS refers to drawing
        something in the graphics window. Plot one type of entity (lines,
        elements, etc.) to the screen at a time. To plot more than one kind of
        entity use, <custom-process>“Plot > Multiplot”</custom-process>, which by default will plot everything in
        the model at once.</custom-spacing>
        <custom-spacing><custom-style>Plot Controls:</custom-style>his refers to how the “plot” has to look on the screen
        (shaded, wireframe, entity numbers on or off, etc). Other plot control
        functions include sending an image to a graphics file or printer.</custom-spacing>
        <custom-spacing><custom-style>Raise hidden:</custom-style> If a dialog box disappears behind the main window, bring
        it back with this.<br></custom-spacing>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/20.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.18 Output Window</image-tag><br>
    
        The analyst can resize the toolbar, Main Menu and Graphics Window,
        as well as the GUI. In order to resize the areas in the GUI, drag the borders
        around the areas of the GUI while holding down the left mouse button.<br>
        In order to change the overall size of the GUI, position the mouse on
        of the corners of the GUI and drag it diagonally towards the center of the GUI
        while holding down the left mouse button. Save the GUI size settings by
        selecting <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Save Menu Layout</custom-process>.<br>
        The GUI iconified. Later to completely remove the program from the
        screen without terminating the session, the session can be brought back by
        restoring the icon. The remainder of this section describes each of the areas
        of the GUI.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.5.2.1 The Utility Menu</sub-heading><br>
        The Utility Menu contains utility functions such as file controls,
        selecting, graphics controls, and parameters. Most of these functions can be
        executed anytime during the session. For example, while picking locations on
        the working plane to create keypoints, the analyst can select <custom-process>Utility Menu>
        PlotCtrls> Pan-Zoom-Rotate> Iso</custom-process> to change the view to an isometric view.<br>
        Each menu topic on the Utility Menu brings up a pull-down menu of
        subtopics, which in turn either cascade to a submenu (indicated by a >) or
        perform an action. The action may do any of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Immediately execute a function</li>
            <li>Bring up a dialog box (indicated by a ...)</li>
            <li>Bring up a picking menu (indicated by a +).</li>
        </ul>
        Figure 1.19 shows the pull-down list of subtopics seen when
        the List topic is selected:<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/21.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.19 Example of a Pull-Down, Cascading Menu</image-tag><br>
    
        Left mouse button is used to "pull down" a menu topic on the Utility
        Menu. Pressing and dragging the mouse button permits to move rapidly to
        the desired subtopic. Releasing the mouse button while it is on an "action"
        subtopic causes the program to perform that action. Clicking the left mouse
        button leaves the pull-down and cascading menus in place. The menus
        disappear when the analyst clicks on an action subtopic or elsewhere in the
        GUI.<br>
        Use the keyboard to pull down a menu topic and move to the desired
        function. Do so via the menu's mnemonic character, indicated by an
        underscore. Simply place the mouse cursor anywhere in the Utility Menu and
        press the ALT key and the mnemonic character simultaneously. For example,
        pressing ALT+F with the mouse cursor anywhere in the Utility Menu pulls
        down the File menu, since F is the mnemonic (indicated by the underscore
        in File).<br>
        Once the pull-down menu appears, the analyst can use the other
        mnemonic characters (without the ALT) or the arrow keys on the keyboard to
        navigate to the desired menu topic and the ENTER or RETURN key to "pick"
        it.<br>
        The Utility Menu lists 10 topics. A brief description of each topic
        follows.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>File - Contains file and database related functions, such as clearing the
            database, saving it to a file, and resuming it from a file. Some of the
            functions under the File menu are valid at Begin level only. If the
            analyst selects such a function when not at Begin level, s/he will see a
            dialog box giving a choice of moving to Begin level and executing the
            function or cancelling the function.</li>
            <li>Select - Includes functions that allow to select subsets of entities and
            to create components.</li>
            <li>List - Enables to list virtually any data item stored in the database. The
            analyst can also obtain status information about different areas of the
            program and list the contents of files residing on the system.</li>
            <li>Plot - Plots keypoints, lines, areas, volumes, nodes, elements, and
            other data that can be graphically displayed.</li>
            <li>PlotCtrls - Includes functions which control the view, style, and other
            characteristics of graphics displays.</li>
            <li>The Hard Copy function helps in obtaining hard copies of the entire
            screen or just the Graphics Window.</li>
            <li>WorkPlane - Enables to toggle the working plane on or off and to
            move, rotate, and otherwise maneuver the working plane. The analyst
            can also create, delete, and switch coordinate systems by using this
            menu.</li>
            <li>Parameters - Includes functions to define, edit, and delete scalar and
            array parameters.</li>
            <li>Macro - Allows to execute macros and data blocks. The analyst can
            also create, edit, and delete abbreviations, which appear as push
            buttons on the Toolbar.</li>
            <li>MenuCtrls - Permits to create, edit, and delete abbreviations on the
            Toolbar Once the analyst adjusts the GUI to her/his liking, s/he can
            use the Save Menu Layout function to save the current GUI
            configuration.</li>
        </ul>
        <sub-heading>1.5.2.2 The Standard Toolbar</sub-heading><br>
        The Standard Toolbar (Fig. 1.20) contains a set of icon buttons that
        execute commonly -used functions.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/22.jpg" alt="image" width="700px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.20 Standard Toolbar</image-tag><br>
    
        By default, the Standard Toolbar is loaded and positioned when the
        analyst starts ANSYS. The Standard Toolbar is defined at start up, and cannot
        be modified during the session. The standard buttons and their functions
        include:
        <ul>
            <li>New Analysis: Saves and clears information for the existing analysis and
            starts a new analysis.</li>
            <li>Open File: Reads database or input files to be read into ANSYS. The file type
            determines the operation.</li>
            <li>Save Analysis: Saves the current analysis to a database file.</li>
            <li>Pan-Zoom-Rotate: Opens the Pan-Zoom-Rotate dialog box.</li>
            <li>Image Capture: Opens the image capture GUI.</li>
            <li>Report Generator: Opens the report generator GUI.</li>
            <li>Help: Displays the table of contents for the HTML-based help.</li>
            <li>Raise Hidden: Raises hidden windows to the top of the application.</li>
            <li>Reset Picking: Resets the picking menu if it becomes unresponsive or does
            not appear when invoked via a menu pick or a command in the Input
            Window.</li>
            <li>Contact Manager: Opens the Contact Manager GUI.</li>
        </ul>
        <sub-heading>1.5.2.3 Command Input Options</sub-heading><br>
        Although the GUI provides intuitive graphical access, the analyst can
        provide input to the program by typing in commands, even while the GUI is
        active. There are two modes available for directly entering commands during
        the analysis. The Single Line Input Window displays only one line and uses a
        drop-down window to display the command history. The Command Window
        can be used for more intensive command operations, such as pasting in
        multiple command strings or copying longer strings and selected commands
        from the history window. Both modes are described below.<br>
        The Single Line Input Window<br>
    
        The Input Window (Fig. 1.21) is the default display for all GUI
        operations. The Input Window is used to conveniently enter single
        commands. It is also used to access the history buffer without changing the
        overall configuration of the GUI. As commands are entered into the Input
        Window, dynamic command help appears in a box above the window. As the
        analyst types the letters, the command help displays the possible commands,
        and guides through the proper spelling and syntax of the command.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/23.jpg" alt="image" width="700px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.21 Single Line Input Window</image-tag><br>
    
        The history buffer contains all previously entered commands. Individual
        lines from the history buffer can be displayed in the Input Window and
        indexed with the up or down arrow keyboard keys. Once displayed in the
        window, the analyst can edit the entry and execute it by using the return key.
        View and access the history buffer by clicking the down arrow on the
        right of the text entry box. A drop down list containing the entry history
        appears. Clicking the left mouse button on any line in the history buffer
        moves that line to the text entry box where the analyst can edit and execute
        it. A double click on any line in the history buffer automatically executes that
        line.<br>
        The vertical scroll bar at the right corner of the (unhighlighted) history
        buffer box allows to scroll through the history buffer. The up and down arrow
        keys can also be used to navigate the history buffer.<br>
        The Floating Command Window<br>
        Bring the Floating Command Window (Fig. 1.22) up by clicking on the
        keyboard icon at the left side of the Single Line Input Window. The Command
        Window is a floating window that can be resized and positioned easily for
        more complex command entry operations. When the command window is
        closed, all the operations will appear in the history buffer.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/24.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.22 The Floating Command Window</image-tag><br>
    
        When the command history is accessed with the command window,
        select commands from the buffer, and selectively enter them into input line,
        in any order of selection. Do this by holding down the <custom-process>Ctrl</custom-process> key and clicking on
        each command. As this is done, the commands appear in the input line
        below. Then edit the commands, changing parameters or syntax, before
        hitting enter to execute them.<br>
        The size and location of the Floating Command Window can be set to
        the desired orientation. Then use the <custom-process>“Save Menu Layout”</custom-process> feature to make it
        default. The Single Line Window will be available when the Command Window
        is closed, but will no longer be the default.<br>
        The Command Window provides a scrollable, editable text area where
        individual commands can be entered or pasted in long command strings.
        Multiple commands can also be selected from the history buffer area, either
        using the shift key to select large contiguous portions of the history, or the
        control key to select multiple, individual commands. Like the Input Window,
        dynamic command help is available; as command is typed, the probable
        command is displayed. This display shows the complete command syntax,
        and stays visible so that the help system can be checked.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.5.2.4 The Toolbar</sub-heading><br>
        The Toolbar (Fig. 1.23) is a convenient area where push-buttons can
        be added for command, function and macro shortcuts. The Toolbar is a set of
        push buttons that execute commonly used functions. The toolbar can be set
        up to provide one-button access to the favorite and frequently used functions.
        It is loaded and positioned by default, and can be modified during the
        session. Some push buttons are predefined, but all others are to be defined
        by the analyst. That is, the analyst selects how many push buttons the
        Toolbar contains (to a maximum of 100) and what functions they execute.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/25.jpg" alt="image" width="300px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.23 The Toolbar</image-tag><br>
    
        <b>Adding Buttons to the Toolbar</b>
        Additional push buttons are added to the Toolbar by creating
        abbreviations. An abbreviation is simply an alias (up to 32 characters long) for
        a complete command or GUI function name. For example, <custom-style>SAVE_DB</custom-style> is an
        alias for the <custom-process>SAVE</custom-process> command and <custom-style>RESUM_DB</custom-style> is an alias for the
        <custom-process>RESUME</custom-process> command. Macros can also be added to the Toolbar by defining an
        abbreviation that executes the macro.<br>
        Creating Abbreviations
        Select <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Edit Toolbar</custom-process> or <custom-process>Macro> Edit
        Abbreviations</custom-process> to create an abbreviation. Both menu choices bring up the
        "Edit Toolbar/Abbreviations" dialog box shown in Fig. 1.24. The Toolbar
        immediately reflects any changes the analyst makes to the abbreviations
        using this dialog box.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/26.jpg" alt="image" width="250px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.24 Edit Toolbar / Abbreviations Dialog Box</image-tag><br>
    
        An abbreviation can also be created by issuing the <custom-process>*ABBR</custom-process> command
        from the Input Window. In this method, it is necessary to update the Toolbar
        manually by picking <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Update Toolbar</custom-process>. The Toolbar
        can be sized to make it smaller or larger to fit the set of abbreviations.<br>
        The order in which abbreviations are defined determines the placement
        of the buttons on the Toolbar. After defining the buttons, they cannot be
        rearranged graphically within the GUI.<br>
        Buttons that execute commands or functions from a processor other
        than the current one will not work. For example, if the analyst is in PREP7 and
        picks a button for a POST1 command, s/he will receive an "unrecognized
        PREP7 command..." warning.<br>
        After creating own set of abbreviations in the Toolbar, the analyst can
        save them in a file by choosing either <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Save
        Toolbar</custom-process> or <custom-process>Utility Menu> Macro> Save Abbr</custom-process>. Pick either <custom-process>Utility Menu>
        MenuCtrls> Restore Toolbar</custom-process> or <custom-process>Utility Menu> Macro> Restore Abbr</custom-process> to
        restore a set of abbreviations from a file.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.5.2.5 Main Menu</sub-heading><br>
        The Main Menu (Fig. 1.25) is where the analyst begins the analysis. It
        contains the analysis functions used to create the model. The Main Menu is
        arranged in a tree structure. This structure has progressive submenus
        accessible as the analyst proceeds through the steps of the analysis. Each
        menu topic in the main menu either expands to show more menu options
        (indicated by a boxed +) or performs an action (indicated by an icon
        preceding the menu topic). Click on the boxed + or the topic name to expand
        a menu topic to reveal the subtopics (the boxed + will turn into a boxed -).
        Continue expanding subtopics (also indicated by a boxed +) until the desired
        action is reached. The action name is preceded by an icon used to indicate
        the action:
        <ul>
            <li>A square for a dialog box</li>
            <li>An arrow for a picking menu.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/27.jpg" alt="image" width="250px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.25 Main Menu</image-tag><br>
    
        <b>Using Preferences to Set Menu Content</b>
        One of the most useful customizations that can be performed from the
        GUI is to apply filtering to the menu choices. Filtering lets grey out, or
        completely hide many of the functions the analyst determines s/he won’t
        need during the analysis. Use the preferences dialog box to adjust the
        filtering.<br>
        At the start of the program, no filtering is applied. Menu choices for all
        analysis disciplines are displayed. Menu items that are not applicable are
        grayed out, based on the context of the analysis. The grayed out items can
        be removed by choosing the appropriate discipline from within the
        <custom-process>“Preferences for GUI Filtering”</custom-process> dialog box. Not all menu options may be visible
        during the analysis. If the desired option is not available, check the
        preferences and element types.<br>
        For example, selecting Thermal suppresses structural, magnetic, and
        fluid element types in the <custom-process>“Element Types”</custom-process> dialog box, displacements, and
        potentials, etc. In the <custom-process>“Apply Loads”</custom-process> and <custom-process>“Delete Loads”</custom-process> menus, and so on.
        Another item is the methodology used for structural analysis: h-method or LS-
        DYNA Explicit. By default, the program uses h-method. The analyst can also
        change the menu hierarchy and customize it to her/his needs by using the
        User Interface Design Language (UIDL), an ANSYS-developed GUI language.<br>
        <sub-heading>Additional Usability Features</sub-heading><br>
        On opening a Main Menu topic, the submenus stay in place until the
        analyst selects a different Main Menu topic. If a menu topic is not seen, scroll
        up or down in the Main Menu area until it is found or click the boxed – to
        collapse subtopics that are no longer in use.<br>
        Individual topics in the Main Menu can be completely expanded to
        reveal each and every subtopic. Right-mouse click context-sensitive control is
        available within the Main Menu to expand and collapse the individual topics.
        Once an individual subtopic is completely expanded, the analyst can
        selectively close topics to have areas at different locations under each main
        topic expanded. As s/he does so, the amount of expansion accessed is
        recorded and replicated in the next time.<br>
        Menus can be set to automatically collapse and expand the subtopics.
        Use the <custom-process>“Collapse Siblings”</custom-process> feature (found in the right-mouse click menu) to
        set the menu expansion preferences. When collapse is selected, the subtopics
        opened automatically collapse when another main topic is selected.<br>
        When many submenus are open, navigating the main menu can
        become confusing, especially when individual submenus are large enough to
        push the heading out of the viewing area. The Preprocessor subtopic alone
        has more than 800 nested subheadings beneath it. Use the same right-mouse
        click context-sensitive control to configure the main menu for selectable
        contrasting color display within each nested level. Designate any color for the
        menu text at each level, making the transition between levels easily
        detectable. This makes navigating within a subtopic, and up to higher levels
        much easier.<br>
        <sub-heading>Main Menu Analysis Functions</sub-heading><br>
        Most of the functions in the main menu are <custom-style>“modal”</custom-style> with respect to
        each other; that is, the analyst must complete one function before starting
        the next. For example, for creating keypoints on the working plane, s/he
        cannot simultaneously create lines or mesh volumes. However, s/he can
        define or edit scalar parameters in the middle of creating keypoints since
        parameter functions are <custom-style>“modeless”</custom-style> Utility Menu functions.<br>
        The Main Menu functions will vary according to the product and type of
        analysis. The following functions are included in the default, non-filtered Main
        Menu:
        <ul>
            <li><custom-processor>Preprocessor</custom-processor> – Enters the modelling processor and contains <custom-processor>PREP7</custom-processor>
            functions such as modelling, meshing, and loads.</li>
            <li><custom-processor>Solution</custom-processor> – Enters <custom-processor>SOLUTION</custom-processor> and contains <custom-processor>SOLUTION</custom-processor> functions
            such as analysis type and options, loads, load step options, and
            solution execution.</li>
            <li><custom-processor>General Postproc</custom-processor> – Enters the general postprocessor and
            contains <custom-processor>POST1</custom-processor> functions such as plotting and listing of results.</li>
            <li><custom-processor>TimeHist Postpro</custom-processor> – Enters the time-history postprocessor and
            loads the Time History Variable Viewer. Contains <custom-processor>POST26</custom-processor> functions
            such as defining, listing, and plotting of variables.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <sub-heading>Additional Main Menu Utilities</sub-heading><br>
        The default main menu also contains the following dialog boxes that
        are available at any time during the analysis:
        <ul>
            <li><custom-process>Session Editor</custom-process> – Opens the session editor</li>
            <li><custom-process>Finish</custom-process> – Exits the current processor and moves to the Begin level by
            executing the <custom-process>FINISH</custom-process> command.</li>
        </ul>
        <sub-heading>1.5.2.6 The Graphics Window</sub-heading><br>
        The Graphics Window is where all graphics displays are drawn and all
        graphical picking is done. It is usually the largest of the GUI windows.
        Maintain the 4:3 width-to-height proportion while changing the size of the
        Graphics Window. Graphics displays are drawn in the Graphics window when
        a plot is requested. In addition, graphics displays that are generated by
        immediate mode and XOR mode will be seen.<br>
        <custom-spacing>Immediate Mode</custom-spacing><br>
        An immediate mode plot is one that is drawn automatically when the
        analyst creates, moves, reflects, or otherwise manipulates the model. It is
        only a temporary graphics display meant to give immediate feedback on the
        function just executed. As a result, an immediate mode plot has two
        drawbacks:
        1. It will be destroyed if a menu or a dialog is brought up on top of it or if
        the GUI is iconified and restored.
        2. Its scaling is based on the scaling for the last plot request, so if the
        new entity lies <custom-style>“outside”</custom-style>the boundaries of that scaled image, it will not
        appear in the Graphics Window. Issue a plot request to see the new
        entity.<br>
        Numbers and symbols drawn in immediate mode have a similar
        drawback: they will disappear when a plot is requested unless they are
        explicitly set to <custom-style>“on”</custom-style> via the appropriate functions under the <custom-process>PlotCtrls</custom-process> menu.
        Immediate mode can be turned off using the <custom-process>Immediate Display</custom-process> function
        under <custom-process>Utility Menu> PlotCtrls> Erase Options</custom-process>.<br>
        If a plot is requested <custom-style>“manually”</custom-style>, the program calculates the graphics
        scaling such that the display fills the window. This is more of a
        <custom-style>“permanent”</custom-style> display in that it stays in place even if it is obscured by a dialog
        box or a menu or if the Graphics Window is iconified and then restored.<br>
        <custom-spacing>XOR Mode</custom-spacing><br>
        The program uses this mode when something needs to be drawn or
        erased quickly without destroying whatever is currently being displayed in the
        Graphics Window. For example, XOR mode takes effect during graphical
        picking to highlight or unhighlight the item being picked. It is also used to
        display the working plane and for rubber-banding.<br>
        The advantage of using XOR mode is that it produces an instantaneous
        display without affecting the existing plot on the screen. The only drawback is
        that drawing in the same location a second time erases the display. For
        example, picking the same node or keypoint a second time erases the
        highlight. Similarly, with the working plane display on, requesting another plot
        without erasing the screen erases the working plane.<br>
        <custom-spacing>Capture Image Feature</custom-spacing><br>
        A useful feature that permits to create <custom-style>“snapshots”</custom-style> of the Graphics
        Window is the <custom-process>Capture Image</custom-process> function (using the <custom-process>Capture Image</custom-process> button in
        the Standard Toolbar or <custom-process>Utility Menu> PlotCtrls> Capture Image</custom-process>). After an
        image is captured, it can be saved to a file and then restored in any session.
        Captured images are useful for comparing different views, sets of results, or
        other significant images simultaneously on the screen.<br>
        <custom-spacing>Mouse Functionality</custom-spacing><br>
        Pressing the scroll wheel button (Fig. 1.26) is the same as a middle
        mouse button.<br>
        Picking Entities:
        Left Button: Picks an entity. Picking is cumulative, so it is not necessary to
        press control or shift to pick more than one entity. Click and hold the button,
        then move the cursor around until the entity under consideration is
        highlighted. When the button is released the highlighted entity will be
        selected.<br>
        Middle Button: Completes a selection. This is like clicking <custom-process>“Apply”</custom-process> in the
        picking dialog (also called <custom-style>“the picker”</custom-style>).<br>
        Right Button: Toggles back and forth between <custom-style>“pick”</custom-style> and <custom-style>“unpick”</custom-style> mode.
        Cursor changes indicating what mode ANSYS is in.<br>
        <div class="container-1">
            <span><img src="./I_Ansys_Basics/28.jpg" alt="image" width="200px"></span>
        </div> 
        <image-tag>Fig. 1.26</image-tag><br>
    
        Manipulating the Model View: (these defaults can be changed to different
        buttons if desired)
        <custom-process>CTRL + Left Button</custom-process>: Pans the model side to side and up and down.<br>
        <custom-process>CTRL + Middle Button</custom-process>: Moves the mouse left and right to rotate about screen
        Z. Up and down zooms in and out.<br>
        <custom-process>CTRL + Right Button</custom-process>: Rotates the model.<br>
        Right Button: Click and drag the right button to zoom in using a window.
        Rolling the scroll wheel also zooms in and out.<br>
    
        When the right button is clicked in the graphics area a pop-up menu
        with some very common graphics functions appears (Fig. 1.27) . ANSYS does
        not always refresh the graphics screen so <custom-process>Replot</custom-process> is very handy. <custom-process>Fit</custom-process> makes the
        whole model visible. <custom-process>Zoom Back</custom-process> will go back to the view the way it was just
        before zooming in. Along with some of the standard <custom-process>Pan-Zoom-Rotate</custom-process>
        functions, the analyst can also access many of the window control functions
        found in the <custom-process>PlotCrtrls</custom-process> section of the Utility Menu. Placing the cursor over the
        legend areas of the Graphics Window channels the context to access the
        legend control menus.<br>

        <sub-heading>1.5.2.7 The Output Window</sub-heading><br>
        The Output Window (Fig. 1.18) receives all text output from the
        program - command responses, notes, warnings, errors, and any other
        messages. It is usually positioned behind the GUI, but it can be raised to the
        front when necessary.<br>

        The size and position of the Output Window can be saved using:
        1. Move the window to the desired location
        2. Size the window to the desired dimensions
        3. Select <custom-process>Utility Menu> MenuCtrls> Save Menu Layout</custom-process>.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.5.2.8 Creating, Modifying and Positioning Toolbars</sub-heading><br>
        When a session is begun, the start up routine reads a number of text
        files and scripts that set parameters and conditions for the session. Many of
        these files can be modified to provide a more customized level of operation.
        The start160.ans file is one such file. Call up toolbars, set their position
        and define their content in a similar fashion.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.5.2.9 Help System</sub-heading><br>
        Much of the ANSYS documentation is available on-line. Type <custom-process>help,
        command</custom-process> to get help on any command. Another option to get help is to
        select <custom-process>HELP</custom-process> on the menu bar at the top of the screen. Information about the
        commands, theory, and element types used by ANSYS can be viewed in Fig.
        1.28.<br>
