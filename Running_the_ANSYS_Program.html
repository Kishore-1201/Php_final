    <custom-heading level="2">1.4 Running the ANSYS Program</custom-heading level='2'><br>
        The ANSYS program can be run in interactive mode or in batch mode.
        In interactive mode, the analyst exchanges information with the program
        continuously. A command can be executed by selecting its menu path in the
        GUI or by typing it in directly. The ANSYS program processes the command in
        real time. Interactive mode permits to use the GUI, online help, and various
        tools to create the model in the graphics window and modify it.
        In batch mode, a file of commands is submitted to the ANSYS. A batch
        job can be run in the background while doing other work on the system.
        Batch mode is useful when there is no need to interact with the program,
        such as during the solution phase. The ANSYS Launcher can be used to set
        options for an ANSYS run.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.4.1 Mechanical APDL Product Launcher</sub-heading><br>
        <sub-heading>1.4.1.1 Starting an ANSYS Session from the Start Menu/Launcher</sub-heading><br>
        Use the Mechanical APDL Product Launcher (Fig. 1.5) to run an ANSYS
        program, one of the auxiliary programs, or to access a modifiable ANSYS file.
        In order to access ANSYS functionality, including the launcher, choose <custom-process>Start >
        All Programs > ACP 2020 R1</custom-process> and select the appropriate option. This causes
        the launcher to appear automatically.<br>

        Start Menu Options on Windows
        Choose <custom-process>Start > All Programs > ANSYS 2020 R1 New > Mechanical
        APDL Product Launcher 2020 R1</custom-process> to activate the launcher on Windows.
        The File Management Tab
        This tab contains the information necessary to manage the files, such
        as location of the working directory and job name. The available options will
        differ depending on the simulation environment selected. In
        the ANSYS simulation environment, the analyst can specify:
        Working directory
        Sets the directory in which the ANSYS run will be executed. The
        program writes files it generates to this directory. Type the new directory
        name in the Working Directory text box to change the working directory or
        press the <custom-process>Browse</custom-process> button to display a file selection dialog box. The working
        directory can be specified by defining the
        ANSYS201_WORKING_DIRECTORY environment variable. If
        ANSYS201_WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, the launcher will use that setting
        as the default. However, any working directory that is specified via the
        launcher (such as a profile) overrides the
        ANSYS201_WORKING_DIRECTORY environment variable setting.<br>
        Jobname
        Defines the base filename used for all files generated by the ANSYS
        run. The initial jobname defaults to file. It can be changed to any
        alphanumeric string up to 32 characters long.
        The Customization/Preferences Tab
        The settings under this tab permit to specify detailed settings about
        the working environment, such as memory settings, parallel/distributed
        processing settings, custom executables, and additional parameters. The
        available options will differ depending on the simulation environment
        selected on the first tab.
        On selecting the ANSYS or ANSYS Batch simulation environment, the
        analyst can specify:
        Custom Memory Settings
        Specifies the use of custom memory settings rather than using the
        default memory model. Select custom memory settings in order to set the -
        m or -db options.
        Total Workspace (MB)
        Specifies the initial allocation of memory requested for the ANSYS run.
        It defaults to 2 GB (2048 MB). This value is adequate for most modest-sized
        models.
        Database (MB)
        Specifies the portion of total memory that the database will use for the
        initial allocation. It defaults to 1GB (1024 MB). This value is adequate for
        most modest-sized models.
        Graphics Device Name
        Sets the graphics device (Fig. 1.6). The GUI requires a terminal that
        supports graphics. The graphics device can be WIN32 (default), WIN32c, or
        3D. The 3D graphics driver facilitates to rotate a shaded view of the model.
        Most newer graphics cards can handle this well.<br>

        <image-tag>Fig. 1.6</image-tag><br>
    
        Read start.ans at start-up
        Indicates whether the start201.ans file is read at start-up. Include
        commands to be executed when the program starts up in
        the start201.ans file. Uncheck the box to not read the start201.ans at
        start-up.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.4.1.2 Launcher Menu Options</sub-heading><br>
        Launcher-specific controls can be found under different launcher menu
        options. The menu options are:
        File: Use the <custom-process>File</custom-process> menu to exit.
        Profiles: Use the <custom-process>Profiles</custom-process> menu to save a specific launcher configuration. The
        profile the analyst is currently running is displayed in the launcher title bar. An
        asterisk (*) follows the profile name if any settings are changed from what is
        saved.
        <ul>
            <li>Click <custom-process>Save Profile</custom-process> to save the current launcher configurations. A
            name can be entered for this profile. The last run profile will
            automatically be set as the default unless the analyst specifies
            otherwise. Check the <custom-process>Set as Default</custom-process> box to set a subsequent profile
            as the default .</li>
            <li>Click <custom-process>Load Profile</custom-process> to select the last run profile or one of the saved
            profiles.</li>
            <li>Click <custom-process>Manage Profiles</custom-process> to rename a profile, specify a different
            default profile, unset a default profile, or delete a profile.</li>
        </ul>
        If the analyst chooses to use the detailed working directory
        browse dialog box, it shows what files are contained in each directory,
        allows creating a new directory, and allows filtering on file type. The
        standard browse dialog displays only the directories from which to
        choose.
        By default, the launcher saves existing output files from batch
        runs. When a new file is created, the old one is renamed
        to jobname.out.<timestamp> when the batch job is started. The
        timestamp is in the format YYYY-MM-DD@hh_mm_ss and reflects the
        date that the file was renamed, not the date the original file was
        created. Uncheck the <custom-process>Save Existing Output Files From Batch
        Runs</custom-process> item under the <custom-process>Options</custom-process> menu on the launcher to overwrite the
        output file rather than renaming it.
        Use the <custom-process>Reset ANSYS GUI Configuration</custom-process> option to return the
        ANSYS GUI to its default configuration if the menus or toolbars have
        been rearranged. This option is especially useful if an ANSYS GUI
        component has been moved out of the screen's viewable area.
        The <custom-process>Delete All Settings/Profiles</custom-process> option deletes all profiles
        saved for this release and sets all <custom-process>Options</custom-process> menu settings back to the
        defaults. The launcher will also close automatically.<br>
        <sub-heading>1.4.2 Interactive Mode</sub-heading><br>
        In interactive mode, the analyst works with menus and dialog boxes to
        drive the ANSYS program. ANSYS graphics capabilities, online help, and other
        tools, such as wizards can be accessed easily.
        The standard ANSYS GUI is the default. The Utility Menu, Standard
        Toolbar, Input Window, ANSYS Toolbar, Main Menu, Graphics Window, Status
        Area, and Output Window are shown in this layout. The toolbars can be
        resized. The overall size of the GUI, the font, and the color can be modified.
        Double-click on the following types of files from the Windows Explorer
        to execute the ANSYS or DISPLAY programs:
        <ul>
            <li>Double-click on a .db or .dbb file to execute the ANSYS program. When
            executed in this way, ANSYS will set the filename to the filename of
            the .db file and the working directory to the directory where the .db file
            resides.</li>
            <li>Double-click on a .grph or .f33 file to execute the DISPLAY program.
            The first plot that appears in the file will be loaded into DISPLAY
            automatically.</li>
        </ul>
        Start Menu Options on Windows
        Choose <custom-process>Start > All Programs > ANSYS 2020 R1 New > Mechanical
        APDL Product Launcher 2020 R1</custom-process> to activate the launcher on Windows.<br>
